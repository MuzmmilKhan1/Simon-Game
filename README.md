# Simon-Game
This is a simple implementation of the Simon Game using React. The Simon Game is a memory game where the player needs to repeat a sequence of colors and sounds generated by the game. The goal is to see how far the player can remember the sequence correctly.

How to Play
Press the 'A' key to start the game.
Watch and listen to the sequence of colors and sounds played by the game.
Repeat the sequence by clicking on the corresponding colored buttons.
If you click the wrong button or miss a step, the game will end.
Try to beat your highest level and challenge your memory skills!
